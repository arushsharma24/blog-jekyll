Hi!

So this is my blog that I'll be hosting on github pages. I wanted to do this for long but persisting with weird framework issues isn't particularly my forte, plus I can't just decide where I wanted to blog, so well, here I go. 

I have made a few other blogs too before this, a few on wordpress.com and a few on blogspot as well, but this is on github, which I consider to be more permanent, and I seem to like it more. Let's see how this goes.

I wanted to actually give this blog link for my GSoC blog link for my application to GNOME, but I couldn't figure it out properly plus I got attracted by the idea of being able to run react code on a static page hosting service like github pages but then I ended up realizing that I don't really know how to use react, lol, so I ended up ditching that idea and just made one on wordpress. Which is pretty neat too, but it has an annoying banner. Anyways, I have unlimited (sorta) power here, let's see what I do with it.

If Jekyll turns out to be another pain in the ass then I'll be ditching this too, sadly.

Anyways, bye!

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
